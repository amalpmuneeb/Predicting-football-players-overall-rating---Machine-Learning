# Predicting Overall Rating of Football Players

This repository contains a machine learning project by Amal P for predicting the overall rating of football players. The project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle, which includes player attributes such as age, height, weight, positions, potential, value, wage, preferred foot, and various skill ratings.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build machine learning models that can accurately predict the overall rating of football players based on their attributes. The models used include decision tree, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), linear regression, random forest, and hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize model performance.

## Key Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset for analysis.
- Explored relationships between player attributes through exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Engineered new features and transformed existing ones to improve model accuracy.
- Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models to predict player ratings.
- Deployed the best-performing model for real-time predictions.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the models and make predictions.
4. Input player attributes to predict their overall rating.

This project uses machine learning to predict football players' overall ratings based on their attributes. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes features like age, height, weight, positions, potential, value, wage, preferred foot, and skill ratings. By employing decision tree, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), linear regression, random forest, and hyperparameter tuning, the project aims to create accurate predictive models.

The workflow begins with data preprocessing, including cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) follows, examining relationships between attributes. Feature engineering enhances model performance by creating new features or transforming existing ones.

The project trains and evaluates multiple machine learning models to predict player ratings. This includes optimizing model parameters through hyperparameter tuning. The best-performing model is then deployed for real-time predictions.

To use this project, clone the repository and install the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the models and input player attributes for predictions.

Contributions and feedback are welcome. The project, led by Amal P, is a valuable resource for assessing football players' performance and potential based on their individual characteristics.
